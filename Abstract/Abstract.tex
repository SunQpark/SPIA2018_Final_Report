This project aims to build a system that is capable of transforming hand-drawn sketches of human face into a photo-realistic face images. In order to do that, CycleGAN, which is a neural networks model based on GAN(generative adversarial networks) was utilized, having our modifications on structure such as U-net based generators. Besides the Celebrity A human face photograph dataset, considerable amount of sketch images were collected and used to train the model after steps of preprocessing. By experiments, we were able to find that the preprocessing steps were critical to the output image quality, and to build a model that can produce results with acceptable quality. In this paper we provides the processes of experiments we've gone through, and some of possible improvements that is considered to be applied in future works.

% In this project, we investigated sketch-to-image translation by implementing CycleGAN to learn the mapping between human face sketch to realistic photograph. We used U-net to form the Generative Adversarial Networks This makes the model possible to train end to end from very few images and guaranteeing the performance of the mapping.
