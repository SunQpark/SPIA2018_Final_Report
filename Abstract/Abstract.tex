This sample report serves two purposes.
First, it introduces the RIPS ``house style''---preferences for how copy is set and laid out on a page.%%

Second, by comparing this document with the {\LaTeX} source, it illustrates the effects of {\LaTeX} code on the resulting typeset.%

(The Abstract should succinctly summarize the purpose and results of the RIPS project. 
Usually, it will be one paragraph of no more than half a page to one page in length.
The Abstract is often the last major component to be written, since it is almost impossible to know what to say until you have essentially completed the project.

The Abstract is self-contained.
For example, unfamiliar acronyms should be used sparingly, and if used, should also be spelled out.
References to the literature should be specified completely, not cited for look-up in the Bibliography.)%%
\footnote{
Note that in front matter the footnote reference can be a symbol, but in the body it is usually a number.
