% TODO: add table about composition of dataset

\subsection{Photograph}

For realistic photographs of human faces, we used Celebrity A~\cite{liu2015faceattributes} which contains more than 200,000 images of celebrity in the world. In addition to having clean images of human faces, this dataset contained `attributes', some additional imformation of images. Though those informations were not used directly as input to our neural networks, they were useful in some progress of preprocessing. We will describe about the details in ~\ref{preprocess}.

\subsection{Sketch}

The main portion of sketch image dataset we used was collected from Google Image search engine. However, 


We also used CUHK face sketch database(CUFS)~\cite{CUHK_faces},
