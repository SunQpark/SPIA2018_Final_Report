This project is to implement CycleGAN to achieve Sketch-to-Image generation. Sketch-to-Image generation is a class of Image-to-Image translation where the goal is to learn the mapping between distinct domains of image, for example, In 2017, Jun-Yan Zhu, Taesung Park, Phillip Isola and Alexei A. Efros achieved transforming a horse image into a zebra using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks. However, in the Sketch-to-Image generation, the mapping between photo and sketch always cause loss in dimension of data, resulting in losting the uniqueness of mapping. Our goal is to train a Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks to learn a mapping \{G:X \rightarrow Y\} such that the distribution of images from \{G(X)\} indistinguishable from the distribution \{Y\} using an adversial loss. In other word, it can generate high quality photo from a sketch image.###Can put more detail on the introduction of GAN above### ###Some result we achieved ###\\

The team would like to thank Tencent for the generous sponsorship of this project. Tencent is founded in November, 1998, Tencent is a leading provider of Internet value added services in China. Since its establishment, Tencent has maintained steady growth under its user-oriented operating strategies. On June 16, 2004, Tencent Holdings Limited (SEHK 700) went public on the main board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.\\
