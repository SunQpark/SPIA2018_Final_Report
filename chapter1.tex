This project is to implement CycleGAN to achieve Sketch-to-Image generation. Sketch-to-Image generation is a class of Image-to-Image translation where the goal is to learn the mapping between distinct domains of image. In 2017, Jun-Yan Zhu, Taesung Park, Phillip Isola and Alexei A. Efros achieved transforming a horse image into a zebra using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks. However, in the Sketch-to-Image generation, the mapping between photo and sketch always cause loss in dimension of data, resulting in losting the uniqueness of mapping. Our goal is to train a Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks to learn a mapping \(G:X \rightarrow Y\) such that the distribution of images from \(G(X)\) indistinguishable from the distribution \(Y\) using an adversial loss. In other word, it can generate high quality photo from a sketch image.\\%%%Can put more detail on the introduction of GAN above %%%Some result we achieved %%%\\

The team would like to thank Tencent for the generous sponsorship of this project. Founded in November, 1998, Tencent is a leading provider of Internet value added services in China. Since its establishment, Tencent has maintained steady growth under its user-oriented operating strategies. On \(16^{\textnormal{th}}\) June 2004, Tencent Holdings Limited (SEHK 700) went public on the main board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.\\
