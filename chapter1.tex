\section{Project Goal}

The goal of this project is to build a system that can generate photo-realistic images from rough sketch pictures. 

\section{Related Works}

Sketch-to-Image generation is a sub-problem of Image-to-Image translation where the goal is to 
learn the mapping between distinct domains of image. 
In 2017, Jun-Yan Zhu et al. achieved transforming a horse image into a zebra using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks. However, in the Sketch-to-Image generation, the mapping between photo and sketch always cause loss in dimension of data, resulting in losting the uniqueness of mapping. Our goal is to train a Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks to learn a mapping \(G:X \rightarrow Y\) such that the distribution of images from \(G(X)\) indistinguishable from the distribution \(Y\) using an adversial loss. In other word, it can generate high quality photo from a sketch image.\\%%%Can put more detail on the introduction of GAN above %%%Some result we achieved %%%\\


The team would like to thank \emph{Tencent} for the generous sponsorship of this project. 
% Founded in November, 1998, Tencent is a leading provider of Internet value added services in China. Since its establishment, Tencent has maintained steady growth under its user-oriented operating strategies.
