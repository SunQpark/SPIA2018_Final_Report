\chapter{Result}\label{Ch:Result}

Figure~\ref{FIG:before_refinement} shows some examples of result before the data refinement steps were applied.
The results seems to contain some face-like objects, but the original faces in the sketch images were not properly translated, resulting in weired colorization in the result. The result of photograph to sketch translation also shows severe artifacts due to the mismatch of locations of faces between datasets.
